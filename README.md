# Random-Password-Generator-using-Python
In this program, we generate random password for our social media handle. We use the random module, pickle module and string module. I personally use this computer program to generate random password. It also secure our password by converting it into binary form. And the same program is able to unhide or decode it to our normal form. So, keep enjoy this program
